   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>3 1/2 cups flour</li>
    <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
    <li>2 1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup vegetable shortening</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>3/4 cup water</li>
    <li>vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    <li>4 cups picadillo (or fully cooked and seasoned ground beef)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Instructions</h3>
   <h4>Dough</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>Into a large bowl, sift flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Add flour and shortening in a large bowl. Using a pastry cutter or fork cut the shortening into the flour. Add the egg and mix using a fork.
    </li>
    <li>Add the water a little at a time, mixing with a fork until brittle and slightly crumbly.</li>
    <li>Dust a work surface with flour, turn the dough out on the work surface. Press the dough together into a rough ball. Knead until soft, smooth and homogeneous.</li>
    <li>Form dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap at room temp for 30min</li>
    <li>Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Using a rolling pin, roll dough out until thin, about 1/8th of an inch. Using a biscuit or cookie cutter, cut out circles about 6in in diameter (3in radius) </li>
   </ol>
   <h4>Assembly and Frying</h4>
   <ol>
    <li>Take a dough round and place a spoonfull of filling in the center (filling should fit comfortably in the center)</li>
    <li>Using the tip of your fingers wet the edges of the dough with water. Fold over to make a half-moon. Pinch the dough together using your fingers, then go over it, pressing it with the teeth of a fork. Return to sheet pan and cover. Repeat with remaining rounds and filling.</li>
    <li>Line a large plate with paper towels. Heat 1 1/2 inches of oil to 350 degrees in a large deep skillet. Working in batches, carefully place turnovers into the oil.</li>
    <li>They should almost immediately begin to puff and float, cook on each side about 2 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
    <li>Transfer to a wire rack to drain and let cool.</li>
   </ol>
